<!-- PE Analysis: determination of price and quantity of a commodity or factor of production without taking into account inter-relationship between prices of commodities or factors of production. Not useful in markets where various commodities and factors are interdependent.
PE Analysis focuses on explaining the determination of price and quantity in a given product or factor market when one market is viewed as independent of other markets. Or has little repercussions on other markets
GE Analysis deals with explaining simultaneous equilibrium in all markets when prices and quantities of all products and factors are considered as variables and interdependent e.g. rise in price of petrol reduced demand of petrol driven automobiles (petrol automobile complement). GE occurs when markets for all commodities and factors and all decision-making agents – consumers, producers, resource-owners – are simultaneously in equilibrium.
Thus in GE Analysis interrelationship among markets of all products and factors are taken into account explicitly.

The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members
Jurisdictions — as of 2015 FATF consists of thirty-four member jurisdictions (including India) and two regional organisations, the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council.
Associate members — as of 2015 there are 8 associate members.
Observer members — as of 2015 twenty five international organisations including for example the International Monetary Fund, the UN with 6 expert groups and the World Bank.
Note

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.

It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members
Jurisdictions — as of 2015 FATF consists of thirty-four member jurisdictions (including India) and two regional organisations, the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council.
Associate members — as of 2015 there are 8 associate members.

Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.

Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.

The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.

The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

FATF Blacklist

Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.

The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.

The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.

Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.

The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

India is also a member of the — Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Eurasian Group (EAG) — both of which are associate members of the FATF.


The Financial Action Task Force (on Money Laundering) (FATF) — is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering.
Following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks — the purpose expanded to act on terrorism financing.
It monitors countries' progress in implementing the FATF Recommendations by ‘peer reviews’ (‘mutual evaluations’) of member countries.
The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris.
The Forty Recommendations and Special Recommendations on Terrorism Financing
The FATF's primary policies issued are the Forty Recommendations on money laundering from 1990 and the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing (TF) — set the international standard for anti-money laundering measures and combating the financing of terrorism and terrorist acts.
Both sets of FATF Recommendations are intended to be implemented at the national level through legislation and other legally binding measures.
One of the Forty recommendations include the establishment of a financial intelligence unit to receive and disseminate suspicious transaction reports.
One of the 9 Special Recommendations (SR) on Terrorism Financing focuses on the role of Non-Profit Organizations.
FATF Blacklist
In addition to FATF's &quot;Forty plus Nine&quot; Recommendations, in 2000 FATF issued a list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCTs), commonly called the FATF Blacklist.
The effect of the FATF Blacklist has been significant, and arguably has proven more important in international efforts against money laundering than has the FATF Recommendations. While, under international law, the FATF Blacklist carried with it no formal sanction, in reality, a jurisdiction placed on the FATF Blacklist often found itself under intense financial pressure.
Types of Members

<pre>[[AttachFilePlugin]] reads binary data from locally-stored files (e.g., images, PDFs, mp3's, etc.) and converts it to base64-encoded text that is stored in tiddlers tagged with&lt;&lt;tag attachment&gt;&gt;. [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]] allows you to use those tiddlers in place of the external path/file references that are normally part of the image and external links wiki syntax.

[[FileDropPlugin]] and [[FileDropPluginConfig]] allow you to quickly create attachment tiddlers simply by dragging files directly from your system's desktop folder display and dropping it onto an open TiddlyWiki document.  Text files are automatically created as simple tiddlers, while binary files are automatically encoded and attached.</pre>

|Description|Store binary files as base64-encoded tiddlers with fallback links for separate local and/or remote file storage|
Store or link binary files (such as jpg, gif, pdf or even mp3) within your TiddlyWiki document and then use them as images or links from within your tiddler content.
&gt; Important note: As of version 3.6.0, in order to //render// images and other binary attachments created with this plugin, you must also install [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]], which extends the behavior of the TiddlyWiki core formatters for embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image]]}}}), linked embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image][link]]}}}), and external/&quot;pretty&quot; links ({{{[[label|link]]}}}), so that these formatter will process references to attachment tiddlers as if a normal file reference had been provided. |

|Description|run-time library for displaying attachment tiddlers|
Runtime processing for //rendering// attachment tiddlers created by [[AttachFilePlugin]].   Attachment tiddlers are tagged with&lt;&lt;tag attachment&gt;&gt;and contain binary file content (e.g., jpg, gif, pdf, mp3, etc.) that has been stored directly as base64 text-encoded data or can be loaded from external files stored on a local filesystem or remote web server.  Note: after creating new attachment tiddlers, you can remove [[AttachFilePlugin]], as long as you retain //this// tiddler (so that images can be rendered later on).
!!!!!Formatters
&lt;&lt;&lt;
This plugin extends the behavior of the following TiddlyWiki core &quot;wikify()&quot; formatters:
* embedded images: {{{[img[tooltip|image]]}}}
* linked embedded images: {{{[img[tooltip|image][link]]}}}
* external/&quot;pretty&quot; links: {{{[[label|link]]}}}
''Please refer to AttachFilePlugin (source: http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#AttachFilePlugin) for additional information.''

|Description|Documentation for AttachFilePlugin|
Store or link binary files (such as jpg, gif, pdf or even mp3) within your TiddlyWiki document and then use them as images or links from within your tiddler content.
!!!!!Inline interface (live)
&gt;see [[AttachFile]] (shadow tiddler)
&gt;&lt;&lt;tiddler AttachFile&gt;&gt;
!!!!!Syntax
&lt;&lt;&lt;
''To display the attach file control panel, simply view the [[AttachFile]] shadow tiddler that is automatically created by the plugin, and contains an instance of the inline control panel.''.  Or, you can write:
{{{
&lt;&lt;attach inline&gt;&gt;
}}}
in any tiddler to display the control panel embedded within that tiddler.  Note: you can actually use any unique identifier in place of the &quot;inline&quot; keyword.  Each unique id creates a separate instance of the controls.  If the same ID is used in more than one tiddler, then the control panel is automatically moved to the most recently rendered location.  Or, you can write:
{{{
&lt;&lt;attach&gt;&gt;
}}}
(with no ID parameter) in SidebarOptions.  This adds a command link that opens the controls as a floating panel, positioned directly to the left of the sidebar.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Binary file content can be stored in three different locations:
#embedded in the attachment tiddler (encoded as base64)
#on your filesystem (a 'local link' path/filename)
#on a web server (a 'remote link' URL)
The plugin creates an &quot;attachment tiddler&quot; for each file you attach.  Regardless of where you store the binary content, your document can refer to the attachment tiddler rather than using a direct file or URL reference in your embedded image or external links, so that changing document locations will not require updating numerous tiddlers or copying files from one system to another.
&gt; Important note: As of version 3.6.0, in order to //render// images and other binary attachments created with this plugin, you must also install [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]], which extends the behavior of the TiddlyWiki core formatters for embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image]]}}}), linked embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image][link]]}}}), and external/&quot;pretty&quot; links ({{{[[label|link]]}}}), so that these formatter will process references to attachment tiddlers as if a normal file reference had been provided. |
When you attach a file, a tiddler (tagged with&lt;&lt;tag attachment&gt;&gt;) is generated (using the source filename as the tiddler's title).  The tiddler contains //''base64 text-encoded binary data''//, surrounded by {{{/%...%/}}} comment markers (so they are not visible when viewing the tiddler).  The tiddler also includes summary details about the file: when it was attached, by whom, etc. and, if the attachment is an image file (jpg, gif, or png), the image is automatically displayed below the summary information.
&gt;Note: although you can edit an attachment tiddler, ''don't change any of the encoded content below the attachment header'', as it has been prepared for use in the rest of your document, and even changing a single character can make the attachment unusable.  //If needed, you ''can'' edit the header information or even the MIME type declaration in the attachment data, but be very careful not to change any of the base64-encoded binary data.//
Unfortunately, embedding just a few moderately-sized binary files using base64 text-encoding can dramatically increase the size of your document.   To avoid this problem, you can create attachment tiddlers that define external local filesystem (file://) and/or remote web server (http://) 'reference' links, without embedding the binary data directly in the tiddler (i.e., uncheck &quot;embed data&quot; in the 'control panel').

These links provide an alternative source for the binary data: if embedded data is not found (or you are running on Internet Explorer, which does not currently support using embedded data), then the plugin tries the local filesystem reference.  If a local file is not found, then the remote reference (if any) is used.  This &quot;fallback&quot; approach also lets you 'virtualize' the external links in your document, so that you can access very large binary content such as PDFs, MP3's, and even *video* files, by using just a 'remote reference link' without embedding any data or downloading huge files to your hard disk.

Of course, when you //do// download an attached file, the local copy will be used instead of accessing a remote server each time, thereby saving bandwidth and allowing you to 'go mobile' without having to edit any tiddlers to alter the link locations...
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Syntax / Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
To embed attached files as images or link to them from other tiddlers, use the standard ~TiddlyWiki image syntax ({{{[img[tooltip|filename]]}}}), linked image syntax ({{{[img[tooltip|filename][tiddlername]]}}}) , or &quot;external link&quot; syntax ({{{[[text|URL]]}}}), replacing the filename or URL that is normally entered with the title of an attachment tiddler.

embedded image data:
&gt;{{{[img[Meow|AttachFileSample]]}}}
&gt;[img[Meow|AttachFileSample]]
embedded image data with link to larger remote image:
&gt;{{{[img[click for larger view|AttachFileSample][AttachFileSample2]]}}}
&gt;[img[click for larger view|AttachFileSample][AttachFileSample2]]
'external' link to embedded image data:
&gt;{{{[[click to view attachment|AttachFileSample]]}}}
&gt;[[click to view attachment|AttachFileSample]]
'external' link to remote image:
&gt;{{{[[click to view attachment|AttachFileSample2]]}}}
&gt;[[click to view attachment|AttachFileSample2]]
regular ~TiddlyWiki links to attachment tiddlers:
&gt;{{{[[AttachFileSample]]}}} [[AttachFileSample]]
&gt;{{{[[AttachFileSample2]]}}} [[AttachFileSample2]]
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Defining MIME types
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When you select a source file, a ''[[MIME|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME]]'' file type is automatically suggested, based on filename extension.  The AttachFileMIMETypes tiddler defines the list of MIME types that will be recognized by the plugin.  Each MIME type definition consists of exactly two lines of text: the official MIME type designator (e.g., &quot;text/plain&quot;, &quot;image/gif&quot;, etc.), and a space-separated list of file extensions associated with that type.  List entries are separated by &quot;----&quot; (horizontal rules).
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Known Limitations
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Internet Explorer does not support the data: URI scheme, and cannot use the //embedded// data to render images or links.  However, you can still use the local/remote link definitions to create file attachments that are stored externally.  In addition, while it is relatively easy to read local //text// files, reading binary files is not directly supported by IE's FileSystemObject (FSO) methods, and other file I/O techniques are subject to security barriers or require additional MS proprietary technologies (like ASP or VB) that make implementation more difficult.  As a result, you cannot //create// new attachment tiddlers using IE.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Installation
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Import (or copy/paste) the following tiddlers into your document:
* [[AttachFilePlugin]] (tagged with &lt;&lt;tag systemConfig&gt;&gt;)
* [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]] (&quot;runtime distribution library&quot;) (tagged with &lt;&lt;tag systemConfig&gt;&gt;)
* [[AttachFileSample]] and [[AttachFileSample2]] //(tagged with &lt;&lt;tag attachment&gt;&gt;)//
* [[AttachFileMIMETypes]] //(defines binary file types)//
&gt; Important note: As of version 3.6.0, in order to //render// images and other binary attachments created with this plugin, you must also install [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]], which extends the behavior of the TiddlyWiki core formatters for embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image]]}}}), linked embedded images ({{{[img[tooltip|image][link]]}}}), and external/&quot;pretty&quot; links ({{{[[label|link]]}}}), so that these formatter will process references to attachment tiddlers as if a normal file reference had been provided. |
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2009.06.04 4.0.0 changed attachment storage format to use //sections// instead of embedded substring markers.
2008.07.21 3.9.0 Fixup for FireFox 3: use HTML with separate text+button control instead of type='file' control
2008.05.12 3.8.1 automatically add 'attach' task to backstage (moved from BackstageTweaks)
2008.04.09 3.8.0 in onChangeSource(), if source matches current document folder, use relative reference for local link.  Also, disable 'embed' when using IE (which //still// doesn't support data: URI)
2008.04.07 3.7.3 fixed typo in HTML for 'local file link' so that clicking in input field doesn't erase current path/file (if any)
2008.04.07 3.7.2 auto-create AttachFile shadow tiddler for inline interface
2008.01.08 [*.*.*] plugin size reduction: documentation moved to ...Info
2007.12.04 [*.*.*] update for TW2.3.0: replaced deprecated core functions, regexps, and macros
2007.12.03 3.7.1 in createAttachmentTiddler(), added optional &quot;noshow&quot; flag to suppress display of newly created tiddlers.
2007.10.29 3.7.0 code reduction: removed support for built-in upload to server... on-line hosting of binary attachments is left to the document author, who can upload/host files using 3rd-party web-based services (e.g. www.flickr.com, ) or stand-alone applications (e.g., FTP).
2007.10.28 3.6.0 code reduction: removed duplicate definition of image and prettyLink formatters.  Rendering of attachment tiddlers now //requires// installation of AttachFilePluginFormatters
2007.03.01 3.5.3 use apply() to invoke hijacked function
2007.02.25 3.5.2 in hijack of &quot;prettyLink&quot;, fix version check for TW2.2 compatibility (prevent incorrect use of fallback handler)
2007.01.09 3.5.1 onClickAttach() refactored to create separate createAttachmentTiddler() API for use with FileDropPluginHandlers
2006.11.30 3.5.0 in getAttachment(), for local references, add check for file existence and fallback to remote URL if local file not found.  Added fileExists() to encapsulate FF vs. IE local file test function (IE FSO object code is TBD).
2006.11.29 3.4.8 in hijack for PrettyLink, 'simple bracketed link' opens tiddler instead of external link to attachment
2006.11.29 3.4.7 in readFile(), added try..catch around initWithPath() to handle invalid/non-existent paths better.
2006.11.09 3.4.6 REAL FIX for TWv2.1.3: incorporate new TW2.1.3 core &quot;prettyLink&quot; formatter regexp handling logic and check for version &lt; 2.1.3 with fallback to old plugin code.  Also, cleanup table layout in HTML (added &quot;border:0&quot; directly to table elements to override stylesheet)
2006.11.08 3.4.5 TEMPORARY FIX for TWv2.1.3: disable hijack of wikiLink formatter due to changes in core wikiLink regexp definition.  //Links to attachments are broken, but you can still use {{{[img[TiddlerName]]}}} to render attachments as images, as well as {{{background:url('[[TiddlerName]]')}}} in CSS declarations for background images.//
2006.09.10 3.4.4 update formatters for 2.1 compatibility (use this.lookaheadRegExp instead of temp variable)
2006.07.24 3.4.3 in prettyLink formatter, added check for isShadowTiddler() to fix problem where shadow links became external links.
2006.07.13 3.4.2 in getAttachment(), fixed stripping of newlines so data: used in CSS will work
2006.05.21 3.4.1 in getAttachment(), fixed substring() to extract data: URI (was losing last character, which broken rendering of SOME images)
2006.05.20 3.4.0 hijack core getRecursiveTiddlerText() to support rendering attachments in stylesheets (e.g. {{{url([[AttachFileSample]])}}})
2006.05.20 3.3.6 add &quot;description&quot; feature to easily include notes in attachment tiddler (you can always edit to add them later... but...)
2006.05.19 3.3.5 add &quot;attach as&quot; feature to change default name for attachment tiddlers.  Also, new optional param to specify tiddler name (disables editing)
2006.05.16 3.3.0 completed XMLHttpRequest handling for GET or POST to configurable server scripts
2006.05.13 3.2.0 added interface for upload feature.  Major rewrite of code for clean object definitions.  Major improvements in UI interaction and validation.
2006.05.09 3.1.1 add wikifer support for using attachments in links from &quot;linked image&quot; syntax: {{{[img[tip|attachment1][attachment2]]}}}
2006.05.09 3.1.0 lots of code changes: new options for attachments that use embedded data and/or links to external files (local or remote)
2006.05.03 3.0.2 added {{{/%...%/}}} comments around attachment data to hide it when viewing attachment tiddler.
2006.02.05 3.0.1 wrapped wikifier hijacks in initAttachmentFormatters() function to eliminate globals and avoid FireFox 1.5.0.1 crash bug when referencing globals
2005.12.27 3.0.0 Update for TW2.0.  Automatically add 'excludeMissing' tag to attachments
2005.12.16 2.2.0 Dynamically create/remove attachPanel as needed to ensure only one instance of interface elements exists, even if there are multiple instances of macro embedding.
2005.11.20 2.1.0 added wikifier handler extensions for &quot;image&quot; and &quot;prettyLink&quot; to render tiddler attachments
2005.11.09 2.0.0 begin port from old ELS Design adaptation based on ~TW1.2.33
2005.07.20 1.0.0 Initial release (as adaptation)

|Description|list/jump to tiddlers viewed during this session plus &quot;back&quot; button/macro|
This plugin provides a list of links to all tiddlers opened during the session, creating a &quot;trail of breadcrumbs&quot; from one tiddler to the next, allowing you to quickly navigate to any previously viewed tiddler, or select 'home' to reset the display to the initial set of tiddlers that were open at the start of the session (i.e., when the document was loaded into the browser).

&lt;&lt;option chkBreadcrumbsHideHomeLink&gt;&gt; omit 'Home' link from breadcrumbs display
&lt;&lt;option chkBreadcrumbsSave&gt;&gt; prompt to save breadcrumbs when 'Home' link is pressed
&lt;&lt;option chkShowStartupBreadcrumbs&gt;&gt; show breadcrumbs for 'startup' tiddlers
&lt;&lt;option chkBreadcrumbsReverse&gt;&gt; show breadcrumbs in reverse order (most recent first)
&lt;&lt;option chkBreadcrumbsLimit&gt;&gt; limit breadcrumbs display to {{twochar{&lt;&lt;option txtBreadcrumbsLimit&gt;&gt;}}} items

&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2011.02.16 2.1.4 in refresh(), use 'inline' instead of 'block' style (avoids unwanted linebreak).  In previousTiddler(), allow handling even if not in a tiddler so that back button can be placed in ~MainMenu or ~SidebarOptions.

This plugin extends the {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro syntax so you can retrieve and wikify content directly from external files or remote URLs.  You can also define alternative &quot;fallback&quot; sources to provide basic &quot;import on demand&quot; handling by automatically creating/importing tiddler content from external sources when the specified ~TiddlerName does not already exist in your document.

|Description|documentation for ExternalTiddlersPlugin|
This plugin extends the {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro syntax so you can retrieve and wikify content directly from external files or remote URLs.  You can also define alternative &quot;fallback&quot; sources to provide basic &quot;import on demand&quot; handling by automatically creating/importing tiddler content from external sources when the specified ~TiddlerName does not already exist in your document.
!!!!!Configuration
&gt;see ExternalTiddlersPlugin
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
The standard TiddlyWiki core syntax for the {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro is:
&gt;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler TiddlerName with: param param param ...&gt;&gt;}}}
where the optional {{{with: param param param...}}} values are used to replace any corresponding &quot;substitution markers&quot; ($1 to $9) that may be embedded in the referenced tiddler content.

This plugin allows the {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro to ''use external file/URL references in place of the usual ~TiddlerName parameter'', so that you can render wiki-formatted source content retrieved from an external file/URL reference (as determined by the core's isExternalLink() test function), ''//as if// it had come from a tiddler in the current document''.  The external file/URL can be either ''a relative or absolute reference'' and can contain ''&quot;plain text&quot; or a full TiddlyWiki document''.  When using a TiddlyWiki document, you must specify which tiddlers should be included in the output by appending a permaview-like suffix to the file or URL reference, e.g.:
&gt;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler &quot;myfile.txt&quot; with: param param param...&gt;&gt;}}}
&gt;or
&gt;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler &quot;myfile.html#TiddlerName TiddlerName...&quot; with: param param param...&gt;&gt;}}}
&gt;or
&gt;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler &quot;http://www.TiddlyWiki.com/index.html#HelloThere&quot; with: param param param...&gt;&gt;}}}
If the plugin-enhanced {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro is unable to retrieve the external content --  perhaps because the file doesn't exist or doesn't contain the requested tiddler(s), or cross-domain security blocked file access, or the network/server &quot;timed out&quot;, etc., -- then it produces no output (i.e., just as when the standard {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler&gt;&gt;}}} macro is given a ~TiddlerName does not exist in the current document.)
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Using alternative &quot;fallback&quot; references
&lt;&lt;&lt;
In addition to using external file/URL references in place of the usual ~TiddlerName, the plugin also allows you to use a ''fallback list'' consisting of a combination of alternative sources: tiddlers, local files, and/or URL references, each separated by &quot;|&quot;.  The first reference in a fallback list is the &quot;primary source&quot;; the remaining references are &quot;fallback sources&quot;.  The plugin will attempt to retrieve content from each fallback source until one is successfully retrieved or all alternatives have been tried.

For example, if you create a tiddler called [[HelloThere]], as well as a remotely-hosted TW document containing a published tiddler, also called [[HelloThere]], then you can write:
&gt;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler [[HelloThere|http://www.TiddlyWiki.com/#HelloThere]]&gt;&gt;}}}
When [[HelloThere]] is present in the local document, it is processed in the normal manner.  However, if you delete the  local [[HelloThere]] tiddler, the plugin will attempt to retrieve the [[HelloThere]] tiddler from the indicated remote URL.

Please note: although you can list any number of alternative sources, in whatever order you prefer, retrieval from a remote URL occurs asynchronously via XMLHttpRequest() processing.  As a consequence, there can be ''no more than one remote URL reference in the fallback list'', and any alternatives that follow a remote URL reference will not be processed.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Automatically import/create missing tiddlers
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When content is retrieved from an external fallback source, the plugin can automatically import/create tiddler(s) containing that content into your document, allowing you to display, modify, save and/or search for text in that tiddler from within your own document, without needing to retrieve it again from the external source.

If no local ~TiddlerName(s) are specified in the fallback list (i.e., only direct file/URL references are present), then a tiddler will NOT be created, so that each time you render the tiddler display the external source will be re-read in order to render the most recently saved external file content.  To illustrate using the example from above:
&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler [[HelloThere|http://www.TiddlyWiki.com/#HelloThere]]&gt;&gt;}}}
will automatically create a locally-stored [[HelloThere]] tiddler, so that the external source is only accessed the first time the content is rendered, while:
&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{{&lt;&lt;tiddler [[http://www.TiddlyWiki.com/#HelloThere]]&gt;&gt;}}}
will re-load the content from the external source each time the display is rendered.

For easy identification, any tiddlers that are automatically created/imported are tagged with &lt;&lt;tag external&gt;&gt; (or other custom-defined tag values).  These tiddlers can also be automatically tagged with &lt;&lt;tag temporary&gt;&gt; for use with [[TemporaryTiddlersPlugin]], which will skip over those tiddlers when saving changes to your document so that when you reload the document, the temporary tiddlers will no longer be present and will be retrieved anew from the external source, on demand, when (or if) they are needed.  Important reminder: ''If you modify a temporary tiddler and want to retain it in your local document, be sure to remove the &lt;&lt;tag temporary&gt;&gt; tag from the tiddler before saving.''
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!~XMLHttpRequest: performance and security issues
&lt;&lt;&lt;
This plugin uses asynchronous XMLHttpRequest() processing to access external content directly from URLs hosted on remote web servers.  However, ''cross-domain access from one remote domain to another using XMLHttpRequest() processing is generally restricted for security reasons''.  As a result, URL references between server-hosted documents will not work unless those documents are located within the same domain.  In order to ensure that external content included in server-hosted documents will be displayed as intended, you should ''always use either a relative path/file reference or an http: reference located on the same domain as the published document.'' for any document you intend to publish.

Note: Some hosting providers, such as http://www.TiddlySpot.com/ offer ''&quot;proxy&quot; services that may allow you to bypass the security restrictions'' for certain designated remote web sites.  Consult your hosting service for information regarding their proxy arrangments (if any).

''requires FireFox or another Mozilla-compatible browser.''
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
This plugin automatically creates tiddlers from files that are dropped onto an open TiddlyWiki document.  You can drop multiple selected files and/or folders to create many tiddlers at once.  New tiddler titles are created using the filename of each dropped file (i.e., omitting the path).  If a title is already in use, you are prompted to enter a new title for that file.  If you drop a folder, you will be asked if you want to create a simple 'directory list' of files in a single tiddler or create one tiddler for each file in that folder.  

By default, it is assumed that all dropped files contain text.  However, if [[AttachFilePlugin]], [[AttachFilePluginFormatters]] and [[AttachFileMIMETypes]] are installed, then you can drop ''//binary data files//'' as well as text files.  If the MIME type of a dropped file is not &quot;text/plain&quot;, then AttachFilePlugin is used to create an 'attachment' tiddler, rather than creating a simple text tiddler.

When creating text tiddlers, you can embed a //link// to the original external file at the top of the new tiddler, in addition to (or instead of) the text content itself.  The format for this link (see Configuration, below) uses embedded ''//replacement markers//'' that allow you to generate a variety of wiki-formatted output, where:
*%0 = filename (without path)
*%1 = local &quot;&quot;&quot;file://...&quot;&quot;&quot; URL
*%2 = local path and filename (OS-native format)
*%3 = relative path (if subdirectory of current document directory)
*%4 = file size
*%5 = file date
*%6 = current date
*%7 = current ~TiddlyWiki username
*\n = newline
By default, the link format uses the filename (%0) and local URL (%1), enclosed within a //hidden section// syntax, like this:
{{{
/%
!link
[[%0|%1]]
!end
%/
}}}
This permits the link to be embedded along with the text content, without changing the appearance of that content when the tiddler is viewed.  To display the link in your tiddler content, use:
{{{
&lt;&lt;tiddler TiddlerName##link&gt;&gt;
}}}
&lt;&lt;&lt;

			+nsiFile.path+'\n'
			+'onto the page, it will be imported as a tiddler. Is that ok?'
		if(confirm(msg)) {
			var newDate = new Date();

			store.saveTiddler(title,title,loadFile(nsiFile.path),config.options.txtUserName,newDate,[]);
		}
		return true;
	});
}}}
Adds a single file without confirmation, using path/filename as tiddler title:

	function(nsiFile) {
		var newDate = new Date();
		store.saveTiddler(nsiFile.path,nsiFile.path,loadFile(nsiFile.path),config.options.txtUserName,newDate,[]);

<pre>The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest man-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth.[9][10] The ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.[11]

The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology, and other fields.[12][13][14] The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars.[15] The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.[16]

The ISS is the ninth space station to be inhabited by crews, following the Soviet and later Russian Salyut, Almaz, and Mir stations as well as Skylab from the US. The station has been continuously occupied for 16 years and 203 days since the arrival of Expedition 1 on 2 November 2000. This is the longest continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, having surpassed the previous record of 9 years and 357 days held by Mir. The station is serviced by a variety of visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz and Progress, the American Dragon and Cygnus, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle,[17] and formerly the Space Shuttle and the European Automated Transfer Vehicle. It has been visited by astronauts, cosmonauts and space tourists from 17 different nations.[18]

After the US Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011, Soyuz rockets became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the International Space Station, and Dragon became the only provider of bulk cargo return to Earth (called downmass). Soyuz has very limited downmass capability.

The ISS programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA.[17][19] The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.[20] The station is divided into two sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations. As of January 2014, the American portion of ISS is being funded until 2024.[21][22][23] Roscosmos has endorsed the continued operation of ISS through 2024[24] but has proposed using elements of the Russian Orbital Segment to construct a new Russian space station called OPSEK.[25]

On 28 March 2015, Russian sources announced that Roscosmos and NASA had agreed to collaborate on the development of a replacement for the current ISS.[26][27] NASA later issued a guarded statement expressing thanks for Russia's interest in future co-operation in space exploration but fell short of confirming the Russian announcement.[28][29]</pre>

|Type|plugin|
|Description|adds support for resizing images|
This plugin adds optional syntax to scale an image to a specified width and height and/or interactively resize the image with the mouse.
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
The extended image syntax is:
{{{
[img(w+,h+)[...][...]]
}}}
where ''(w,h)'' indicates the desired width and height (in CSS units, e.g., px, em, cm, in, or %). Use ''auto'' (or a blank value) for either dimension to scale that dimension proportionally (i.e., maintain the aspect ratio). You can also calculate a CSS value 'on-the-fly' by using a //javascript expression// enclosed between &quot;&quot;&quot;{{&quot;&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;&quot;}}&quot;&quot;&quot;. Appending a plus sign (+) to a dimension enables interactive resizing in that dimension (by dragging the mouse inside the image). Use ~SHIFT-click to show the full-sized (un-scaled) image. Use ~CTRL-click to restore the starting size (either scaled or full-sized).
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Examples
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{
[img(100px+,75px+)[images/meow2.jpg]]
}}}
[img(100px+,75px+)[images/meow2.jpg]]
{{{
[&lt;img(34%+,+)[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img(21% ,+)[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img(13%+, )[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img( 8%+, )[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img( 5% , )[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img( 3% , )[images/meow.gif]]
[&lt;img( 2% , )[images/meow.gif]]
[img(  1%+,+)[images/meow.gif]]
}}}

|Description|Embed a media player in a tiddler|

!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
{{{&lt;&lt;player [id=xxx] [type] [URL] [width] [height] [autoplay|true|false] [showcontrols|true|false] [extras]&gt;&gt;}}}

''id=xxx'' is optional, and specifies a unique identifier for each embedded player.  note: this is required if you intend to display more than one player at the same time.

''type'' is optional, and is one of the following: ''windows'', ''realone'', ''quicktime'', ''flash'', ''image'' or ''iframe''.  If the media type is not specified, the plugin automatically detects Windows, Real, QuickTime, Flash video or JPG/GIF images by matching known file extensions and/or specialized streaming-media transfer protocols (such as RTSP:).  For unrecognized media types, the plugin displays an error message.

''URL'' is the location of the media content

''width'' and ''height'' are the dimensions of the video display area (in pixels)

''autoplay'' or ''true'' or ''false'' is optional, and specifies whether the media content should begin playing as soon as it is loaded, or wait for the user to press the &quot;play&quot; button.  Default is //not// to autoplay.

''showcontrols'' or ''true'' or ''false'' is optional, and specifies whether the embedded media player should display its built-in control panel (e.g., play, pause, stop, rewind, etc), if any.  Default is to display the player controls.

''extras'' are optional //pairs// of parameters that can be passed to the embedded player, using the {{{&lt;param name=xxx value=yyy&gt;}}} HTML syntax.

''If you use [[AttachFilePlugin]] to encode and store a media file within your document, you can play embedded media content by using the title of the //attachment tiddler//'' as a parameter in place of the usual reference to an external URL.  When playing an attached media content, you should always explicitly specify the media type parameter, because the name used for the attachment tiddler may not contain a known file extension from which a default media type can be readily determined.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Default player size:
width: &lt;&lt;option txtPlayerDefaultWidth&gt;&gt; height: &lt;&lt;option txtPlayerDefaultHeight&gt;&gt;

!!!!!Installation
&lt;&lt;&lt;
import (or copy/paste) the following tiddlers into your document:
''PlayerPlugin '' (tagged with &lt;&lt;tag systemConfig&gt;&gt;)
^^documentation and javascript for macro handling^^
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revision History
&lt;&lt;&lt;
''2007.10.15 [1.1.3]'' in loadURL(), add recognition for .PNG (still image), fallback to iframe for unrecognized media types
''2007.08.31 [1.1.2]'' added 'click-through' link for JPG/GIF images
''2007.06.21 [1.1.1]'' changed &quot;hidecontrols&quot; param to &quot;showcontrols&quot; and recognize true/false values in addition to 'showcontrols', added &quot;autoplay&quot; param (also recognize true/false values), allow &quot;auto&quot; as value for type param
''2007.05.22 [1.1.0]'' added support for type==&quot;iframe&quot; (displays src URL in an IFRAME)
''2006.12.06 [1.0.1]'' in handler(), corrected check for config.macros.attach (instead of config.macros.attach.getAttachment) so that player plugin will work when AttachFilePlugin is NOT installed.  (Thanks to Phillip Ehses for bug report)
''2006.11.30 [1.0.0]'' support embedded media content using getAttachment() API defined by AttachFilePlugin or AttachFilePluginFormatters.  Also added support for 'image' type to render JPG/GIF still images
''2006.02.26 [0.7.0]'' major re-write.  handles default params better.  create/recreate player objects via loadURL() API for use with interactive forms and scripts.
''2006.01.27 [0.6.0]'' added support for 'extra' macro params to pass through to object parameters
''2006.01.19 [0.5.0]'' Initial ALPHA release
''2005.12.23 [0.0.0]'' Started

THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HISTORIAN of philosophy Wilhelm Windelband defined philosophy as the scientific attempt to understand the general nature of the universe and human existence, and to find in that understanding guidance to a worthy and satisfying life. (By the word “scientific” he meant the “methodical work of thought,” what was called //Wissenschaft// in German at the time. If you coupled that with observation and experiment, you would have pretty nearly the current meaning of the word.)

Windelband thought the nineteenth century primarily a “literary” century, but insofar as it was concerned with philosophy he saw it as a struggle between Kant (in one form or another) and what he called “the natural-science conception of phenomena,” namely, the view of the universe that physics, chemistry, and biology had been putting together over the previous 250 years. What is striking is not so much that Windelband believed the natural-science conception of phenomena was winning in the “warfare” with Kant, but that he regarded it as a philosophy by the traditional definition of the subject, a philosophy, in fact, tracing back to “the principles of Democritus.” Furthermore, although he thought it was unable to deal with the “soul” and questions of value, he seems to have assumed it would continue development in the twentieth century.

However, he would have been disappointed. Probably William James was best positioned to carry out this development, since he was not only a philosopher, but a physiologist and psychologist as well. He did indeed attempt to expand and apply the methods of the natural sciences to the broader problems of philosophy, especially problems of value, calling it “pragmatism”; but the scientific metaphysics (the “natural-science conception of phenomena”) had not yet become firmly established and incontrovertible (the physicist Ernst Mach, for example, could still argue that atoms were merely logical constructs built from sense-data), and neurobiology was still in its infancy, so that physiology was only vaguely connected to human psychical life. I think, however, had James been born seventy-five years later, he might have fulfilled Windelband's expectation. (Windelband refers only to the “extremely suggestive” work of William James.)

But philosophy took a different direction in the twentieth century, utterly unforeseen by Windelband. Its springboard was the discovery that mathematics could be equated—or even reduced—to logic by a suitable change in notation. This feat was accomplished by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their three volume //Principia Mathematica.// The discovery was important for two reasons. First, it suggested that what mathematics had done for physics and chemistry, the “natural-science conception of phenomena,” logical analysis could do for philosophy. In both cases, mathematics and logic, statements or propositions (as philosophers preferred to call them) could be analyzed for implication, contradiction, and consistency. In the case of the natural sciences, mathematics had proven enormously powerful in drawing implications for its metaphysics. Perhaps, philosophers believed, the same could be done for philosophy by using logic. Wittgenstein's //Tractatus// and Russell's logical atomism were the first (and last) heady products of this belief. Application of logic to language soon settled down to exposing inconsistencies and confusions inherent in language, first in the language of traditional philosophy and later in the language of ordinary discourse.

The second  consequence of this identification of mathematics with logic was that it allowed philosophers to think of their subject as a kind of science. Mathematics was universally regarded as a scientific activity, though one distinct from the natural sciences. If logic, a traditional part of philosophy since Aristotle, was now proven to be identical to mathematics, then philosophy based on logic or logical analysis could likewise be thought of as a science. Hereafter logic (in its new symbolic form) would become the sine qua non of philosophy, and mastery (or at least competence) in the subject would be the price of admission into the ranks of the professional philosopher. The philosophical ideas or opinions of those who lacked this credential could be ignored as unprofessional and therefore unworthy of attention.

The net result was that the dominant philosophy in the twentieth century became the logical analysis of the //language// of metaphysics, epistemology, and theory of value rather than metaphysics, epistemology, and theory of value themselves. Also, the methods of logical analysis could be extended beyond the language of philosophy to ordinary usage and the language of non-philosophical disciplines. One could have “philosophies of” this or that discipline—psychology, religion, art, science, and so on. Indeed, one could even have philosophies of language, mathematics, and logic themselves, referring to them as “meta-analysis.”

&lt;html&gt;&lt;center&gt;* * * &lt;/html&gt;
Meanwhile the “natural-science conception of phenomena” consolidated its metaphysics and epistemology in the twentieth century, and although professing to be value-free was in fact slipping values into its view of existence through psychology. Thus it has become, as Windelband expected, a complete philosophy in the traditional sense of the term. It provides an understanding of the nature of the universe and human existence, and through psychology professes to offer guidance to a worthy and satisfying life.

Its metaphysics is, of course, extremely complicated—so complicated in fact that most scientists, being specialists, have little interest in and often little understanding of its scope and depth. However, it is fairly simple in its general outlines, and there is, I think, no better presentation of its overall form than the first three lectures of Richard Feynman's //Lectures on Physics// (reprinted in his book //Six Easy Pieces//). Problems certainly remain, especially at the subatomic and cosmological levels, but its overall picture of existence is in place and has to be accepted, for now, as incontrovertible. 

The epistemology on which this metaphysics is based emerged in the last three hundred years (as Stephen Mason discusses in his //History of the Sciences//) from a fertile combination of observation and experiment, emphasized by Francis Bacon, and reasoning, emphasized by Descartes. Since the scientific metaphysics is no longer in doubt, there is no reason to question that epistemology. There can be no doubt, for example, that atoms exist, or that a water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one of oxygen, or that animal species evolved from simpler forms; consequently, there can be no reason to doubt or distrust the epistemology which grounds those conclusions.

The situation is thus quite different from that facing Socrates in fifth century B.C. Athens, or Hume in the eighteenth century. In both these periods metaphysical systems were competing with one another and all were under attack; there seemed no reason to choose one over the other, since all seemed equally plausible or implausible. Thus, epistemology was forced to become radical, resulting in Socrates' systematic doubt and Hume's skepticism. However, since the metaphysics of the scientific philosophy is firmly in place, epistemology is moved to the background as simply the attempt to describe the methods by which that metaphysics is established.

Theory of value, as mentioned, has slipped into the scientific philosophy through psychology, and as Windelband suspected, remains its weakest part. Psychology attempts to investigate human consciousness and behavior, and in the course of its investigations has proposed various ideas of what is healthy and normal, and offered them as values constituting a worthy and satisfying life.

However, the problem of values is much more difficult than that. If science is indeed a philosophy, then its theory of values must be based on or emerge from its metaphysics. That means that psychology needs to be connected systematically and in detail to the function of neural systems in organisms. It needs to understand how neural systems, from their basic function of enabling organisms to move in order to survive and reproduce, can develop in complexity to create human minds capable of producing science, art, religion, and philosophy. Then it needs to consider which among all these neural/mental functions are the most worthy and satisfying. Psychology has not even come close to dealing with such problems, and thus is not close to dealing with philosophical problems of value.     
&lt;html&gt;&lt;center&gt;* * * &lt;/html&gt;
If I were to teach science as philosophy I would, of course, want students to understand in a general way how physics, chemistry, and biology now understand the universe, and how that understanding has developed over the last 400 years. For this purpose Feynman's first three lectures in his physics course would, as mentioned, serve very well. But equally important, the scientific metaphysics needs to seize the student's imagination the way Plato, Kant, Spinoza, and especially the Christian metaphysics of Aquinas and Aristotle seizes it. For example, the student needs to be properly staggered by the sheer numbers involved—the thirteen billion years of creation, the billions of galaxies that exist, the 100,000 light-year diameter of our own galaxy, the variety in the millions of species evolved on our own planet over the last three billion years, and the virtual certainty of life on other planets in the universe. He needs to consider, for example, what it means to say (as the quantum chemist Bernard Pullman wrote in his book,//The Atom in the History of Human Thought//) that at 10^^-43^^ second after the big bang the universe had a diameter of 10^^-33^^ centimeters, and in its &quot;inflationary&quot; phase it expanded in a &quot;brief spurt&quot; between 10^^-35^^ and 10^^-32^^ second by a factor of some 10^^50^^. These are astonishing numbers, and they give substance to what the medieval theologian-philosophers meant by //creatio ex nihilo//—creation from nothing.

Everything else the student needs to be concerned with involves questions of value within this metaphysical framework. The issues center on the evolution of consciousness in the neural systems of organisms and the parameters it lays down for dealing with its most effective and satisfying use. 

Here one is faced with a sort of Scylla and Charybdis situation. On the one side are the analytic philosophers currently dominating academic philosophy who will try to channel the issue into the apparent conflict between “mind” and “body” language, and how that language reveals an unbridgeable or at least inscrutable gap between mental phenomena (like sensations or “qualia”) and physical phenomena (like the firing of neurons). On the other side are scientists themselves, most of whom are specialists investigating only a small area in the vast tapestry of the evolution of neural systems into minds, and do not wish to see philosophers muddying up their research with speculation.

To the philosophers I would say that one reason the gap between mental and physical phenomena appears unbridgeable is that scientists have not yet devised instruments or techniques for recording neural phenomena in their mental function. At this time neurobiology (and medicine) is limited to instruments (like EEGs) which record electrical activity, chemical assay techniques which identify chemicals like potassium and dopamine, and machines which scan the brain for metabolic changes. If, however, some technique could be devised for grafting neurons between organisms, we might come a little closer to bridging the gap. For example, if the afferent neurons running from a hair follicle on the back of two people's hands could be connected, then a stimulus to the hair of one of them might produce a tickle in both. (The example was suggested to me by a neurobiologist, who, however, knew of no attempts by neurobiologists to graft neurons.) Such an achievement would at least undermine the argument that the distinctive mark of mental events is their subjective “first person” nature; for in this case, two people are in a fairly straightforward sense experiencing the same sensation and “getting into each other's minds.”

I would also point out to these philosophers that nature exhibits numerous examples of novelty as great as the production of consciousness in neural systems. For example, oscillating electrons (or electrical current) produces light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation traveling away from those oscillations at a speed of 186,000 miles a second. There is nothing about electrons or electrical current that could have led one to expect such a novel creation. Indeed, without these kinds of novelty nature would be nothing more than a pile of atoms.

To the scientists—the evolutionary theorists, neurobiologists, ethologists, anthropologists, psychologists (and now evolutionary psychologists)—I would say that from the enormous amount of information that has been accumulated in these fields, it is possible to piece together an overall picture of the evolution of consciousness. That overall picture can be summarized as follows:

{{engindent{{{engindent{{{engindent{1. Neural systems evolved originally to enable animals to move so that they can obtain food (survive as individuals), copulate (survive as a species), and manage threats in their environment.

2. Cells and tissues in receptor organs respond to environmental stimuli of only three kinds: chemicals, electromagnetic radiations, and changes in pressure.   

3. These environmental stimuli are integrated by neural circuits into sensations. (See the [[&quot;Qualia&quot;|Qualia]] and [[&quot;Sensations&quot;|Sensations]] entries in Bits and Pieces.)

4. Neural and hormonal systems provide the impulse necessary to respond selectively to these sensations.

5. Selected sensations are organized into behavioral patterns—for example, the fixed action patterns described by ethologists. (See the //umwelt// entries in Bits and Pieces.)

6. Memory develops when sensory neural integrations are activated in the absence of their normal environmental stimuli. Sensitization, habituation, and conditioning are the earliest manifestations of memory. (The research of Eric Kandel and his colleagues on the sea hare //Aplysia// is particularly relevant to this question.)

7. Neural plasticity enables an animal to sort, shape, edit, and assemble this neural content into a variety of forms. This is the stage at which fully formed consciousness appears.}}}}}}}}}

Theory of value—the uses of consciousness which lead to a worthy and satisfying life—must be developed within this metaphysical framework. While setting the parameters to the functions of consciousness, the framework also allows for its enormous development. For example, sensory content limits the substance of our lives to experience, but neural plasticity allows consciousness (through thinking and the methods of science) to transcend that experience and to manipulate existence in ways that change its future content. Also, the mechanism by which sensory content is selected for behavioral response is itself capable of enormous expansion because of the expansion of the content of consciousness brought about by neural plasticity. Ideas and fictionalized experience, for example, become objects of impulse or interest, stimulating the pursuit of knowledge and the creation of art and poetry. The mechanism is even capable of working against itself, as it does in moral behavior, when impulse is converted into the power of will to //not//respond to its demands. The problem of values is how to best manage this complexity of consciousness, with all the tensions and conflicts it creates, as we work our way through life.

At a still deeper level, the problem of values—discovering the most satisfying and worthy uses of consciousness—must deal with the fact (within the scientific metaphysics of course) that with death consciousness appears to perish with the body, and that even its best and most worthy use has no permanence. The problem here is whether consciousness must be thought of as a sort of peacock tail phenomenon, an extravagant and frequently hazardous product of nature's fecundity, or whether with its best use and development it expresses a higher object or outcome of the universe. With this question the scientific metaphysics meets the traditional concerns of religion.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Including and include macro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simple including&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Including is done via the {{{include}}} macro. For instance, a ~TiddlyWiki you'd like to include from is named {{{references.html}}} and is put in the same folder that another one, {{{main.html}}}, you'd like to include to. To include all the tiddlers from {{{references.html}}}, put the following macro in {{{main.html}}}:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./references.html&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}
Where exactly should you write the macro? Usually, {{{include}}} macros are written in IncludeList: all the macros in there are wikified at startup, so the secondary TW is included each time the main one is opened. Alternatively, you can put {{{include}}} macro in an arbitrary tiddler, in that case including will be done when the tiddler is displayed (wikified). If you want to avoid it being visible, write it as
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./references.html&quot; hide&gt;&gt;
}}}

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Partial including&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;There are various reasons why you may prefer to include only a subset of tiddlers from another TW. For instance, you want to include only tiddlers tagged {{{ToDo}}} to your GTD thing and don't want the timeline to get crowded by other tiddlers from outside. For that case {{{include}}} macro supports core filter engine:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./projects/myProject.html&quot; filters:&quot;[tag[ToDo]] [[Summary]]&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}
For more details about filters, see the &quot;Detailed reference&quot; part of the docs.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Substituting tiddlers in main TiddlyWiki&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;By default, if the including and an included TW both have a tiddler named &quot;A&quot;, the tiddler from the main ~TiddlyWiki will be displayed/fetched in all the situations; even if in the main TW only a shadowed tiddler &quot;A&quot; is present. As sometimes this is not a desirable behaviour, there's {{{substitute}}} and {{{substituteShadows}}} options in the {{{include}}} macro:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[PageTemplate]] [[ViewTemplate]]&quot; substituteShadows&gt;&gt;
}}}
will bring PageTemplate and ViewTemplate instead of the shadowed ones; and
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[PageTemplate]] [[ViewTemplate]]&quot; substituteShadows substitute&gt;&gt;
}}}
will do so even if custom PageTemplate or ViewTemplate are created. Note: included tiddlers are not saved in the including TW, unless the {{{import}}} option is used (see below).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Import and autoimport of included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;For some tiddlers, you'd probably prefer importing instead of just including -- for this case a &quot;manual&quot; tool ImportIncluded and autoimport via the {{{include}}} macro are present:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./local_repositories/STP.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[SharedTiddlersPlugin]]&quot; import:4&gt;&gt;
}}}
where {{{4}}} is a number of the import mode. For details, see the &quot;Detailed reference&quot; part.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Launching (wikifying) macros from included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;This feature was designed primarily for centralized system of customization of ~TiddlyWikis. Imagine a TW called &quot;commons.html&quot; which has different parts of interface (like PageTemplate or ToolbarCommands), some evaluated transclusions etc. The idea is do changes to that TW so that they are applied in all your ~TWs. You can include all the elements in other ~TWs but the problem is you still have to make changes in all the ~IncludeLists. The solution is brought by introducing the {{{wikify}}} parameter to the {{{include}}} macro. Consider this: IncludeList in each of your ~TWs contains just
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[IncludeHub]]&quot; wikify&gt;&gt;
}}}
and all the changes are done in the {{{IncludeHub}}} tiddler in your commons.html like these:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[PageTemplate]]&quot; substituteShadows&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./local_repositories/STP.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[SharedTiddlersPlugin]]&quot; import:4&gt;&gt;
 // you can remove, change or add macros in here so that they are applied in each of your TWs
}}}
The only issue is as long as you use relative addresses, you have to place all your ~TWs in the same folder as &quot;commons.html&quot; (how to pass around this limitation, see below).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Launching plugins from included TiddlyWikis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Plugin launching is done on startup, so just including external plugins is &quot;too late&quot; and they won't actually work. To launch a plugin from an included tiddler, use {{{eval}}} parameter of the {{{include}}} macro:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[RearrangeTiddlersPlugin]]&quot; eval&gt;&gt;
}}}
For many plugins, most likely, you will use both {{{improt:4}}} and {{{eval}}} parameters.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reloading included stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Sometimes it's desirable to reload included tiddlers without reloading the whole TW document. For this case, the {{{reloadIncluded}}} macro is introduced. It generates a link/button which reloads tiddlers from certain ~TWs on click:
{{{
&lt;&lt;reloadIncluded urls:'[&quot;node: node1&quot;, &quot;included test nodes/node 2.html&quot;]' reloadParams:'{&quot;import&quot;:false}'&gt;&gt;
}}}
Also, this link can be found in the toolbar of included tiddlers (in the edit mode).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding excessive refreshing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;After including, the {{{include}}} macro refreshes your TW -- this is done for things like ~StyleSheets or ~ViewTemplate to get applied. However, multiple refreshing on startup can take a second or more, so it can be desirable to avoid refreshing. It is recommended to use the corresponding {{{noRefresh}}} parameter with all {{{include}}} macros that don't need it (usually those including content tiddlers, but not elements of themes, like ~ViewTemplate):
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./references/holy writ.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[contents]] [tag[chapter]] [tag[verse]]&quot; noRefresh&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./references/Feuerbach.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[list of publications]] [tag[publication]]&quot; noRefresh&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons.html&quot; filters:&quot;[tag[theme parts]]&quot; substitute substituteShadows&gt;&gt;
}}}

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h1&gt;TwWeb&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Sometimes it is desirable to rename or move ~TiddlyWikis, and such changes can break many links/includes. Also, using relative paths in {{{include}}} macros can cause errors in the path calculation when the macro itself is contained in an tiddler included from &quot;path/A.html&quot;, where &quot;path&quot; is not &quot;.&quot;. To avoid these pesky issues and to enable further &quot;merging&quot; of ~TWs, ~TwWeb system was introduced.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Describing a node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The idea is to describe &quot;nodes&quot; -- ~TWs with certain addresses and then use node names instead of addresses. The {{{describeNode}}} does the first part of the job:
{{{
&lt;&lt;describeNode &quot;commons&quot; &quot;./commons.html&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}
where the first argument is the name of the node and the second one is its address. It is recommended to give your nodes names without spaces (for compability with future features). Note that you can use {{{include}}} macro with {{{wikify}}} parameter to take node descriptions from another TW. This means that you can create a central TW with all node descriptions, include it, and use in all other ~TWs node names instead of addresses. After that, renaming a TW should be backed up by only changing the description in the central node.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Support of node names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Node names are supported in the following mechanisms:
# {{{include}}} macro can get a special form of the url parameter:{{jD{
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;node: node_name&quot; ...&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;node: commons&quot; filters:&quot;[tag[theme parts]]&quot; substitute substituteShadows&gt;&gt;
}}}
}}} If the macro is wikified before the node was described, it &quot;waits&quot; for the description to appear.
# ImportIncluded allows this &quot;form of url&quot; too
# the {{{includedFrom}}} filter supports the {{{[includedFrom[node: nodeName]]}}} notation
# extended prettyLinks now work in the following syntaxes:
## {{{[[link text|target tiddler]]@nodeName}}} -- which includes the {{{target tiddler}}} and creates an ordinary {{{[[link text|target tiddler]]}}} prettyLink
## {{{[[link text|target tiddler]]@nodeName@options line@}}} which does the same but uses options from the {{{options line}}} as well: for instance, to substitute an existing tiddler {{{target tiddler}}}, just add the options line {{{substitute}}}.
** if the included TW is large so you're delayed waiting when the link get enabled, it can be an option to include the node with an empty filter ({{{filters:&quot;&quot;}}}) using IncludeList (may be with the delay option, too)
* @@font-size:smaller;In the future versions of STP, some other engines may be supported: for instance, {{{&lt;&lt;tiddler [[tiddler name]]@nodeName&gt;&gt;}}}.@@

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Describing self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;To avoid different side effects of transitive inclusion (like including a tiddler by TW &quot;A&quot; from the same TW &quot;A&quot; with substituting which makes it impossible to edit the tiddler) you can mark one nodeName as &quot;self&quot;:
{{{
&lt;&lt;describeNode nodeName self&gt;&gt;
}}}
This prevents from including from {{{nodeName}}} at all; such self-description should be put into the IncludeList.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Propagation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;As included tiddlers can contain links, images, transclusions etc, STP takes care of those so that they are not broken (to some extent). See details in the &quot;Detailed reference&quot; section.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inline management of included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;In the edit mode an included (but not imported) tiddler has an additional panel with a link to its &quot;original&quot; in the included TW, a link which imports it and a refresh link that reloads the included TW. This is added by default, no changes to EditTemplate are needed.

!Detailed reference
&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;IncludeList tiddler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Special tiddler IncludeList is used to wikify macros within it on the startup of ~TiddlyWiki: it's implied that you write {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} and {{{&lt;&lt;describeNode&gt;&gt;}}} macros that you need to lauch (each time) there. For instance, if you write
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./common TW elements.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[PageTemplate]]&quot; substituteShadows&gt;&gt;
}}}
in there, the including will be done each time the TW is opened.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The &quot;include&quot; macro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macro has the following syntax (@@font-size:smaller;[...] parts are optional@@):
{{{
&lt;&lt;include [url:]url [filters:filterLine] [substitute] [substituteShadows]
  [import:importMode] [eval] [wikify] [noRefresh] [hide[:hideFlag]] [delay:delayDuration]&gt;&gt;
}}}
|The parameters of the {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macro|c
| name			 | demanded?	 | value | effect | comments |h
| ''url''			 | demanded	 | a url line in quotes | defines the path to the ~TiddlyWiki from which stuff is included | by &quot;url line&quot; a relative path, an absolute local file path, or a &quot;file:&quot; URL is meant |
| ''filters''		 | optional	 | a line of TW filters in quotes | defines the set of tiddlers included from the TW;&lt;br&gt;if omitted, means &quot;include all&quot; | see &quot;Filters&quot; below |
| ''substitute''		 | optional	 | none | adds &quot;substitute&quot; priority to the included tiddlers | see &quot;Name conflicts and priorities&quot; below |
| ''substituteShadows''	 | optional	 | none | adds &quot;substituteShadows&quot; priority to the included tiddlers |~|
| ''import''		 | optional	 | an id of an import mode to use | tiddlers are imported instead of including | see &quot;Import tools&quot; below |
| ''eval''			 | optional	 | none | treats tiddlers as plugins | see &quot;Evaluating tiddlers&quot; below |
| ''wikify''		 | optional	 | none | wikifies tiddlers after loading/importing | can be used to wikify {{{include}}} and other macros;&lt;br&gt;may also be useful with evaluated transclusions |
| ''noRefresh''		 | optional	 | none | prevents refreshing of TW after tiddlers are loaded | refreshing is used to apply included style sheets, elements of interface etc, but multiple refreshing can slow down the startup time; to avoid such effects, this option is to be used in macros that include only content (not parts of the interface) |
| ''hide''			 | optional	 | boulean | by default the macro is displayed as written; when {{{hideFlag}}} is {{{true}}}, it's hidden | can be useful when the macro is used outside ~IncludeList |
| ''delay''		 | optional	 | number (integer) | defines the number of milliseconds (thousands of a second) to wait before actually including the ~TiddlyWiki ||
Some examples of how the ''url'' line can be written:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;C:\TiddlyWiki\shared\TiddlyWikiHelp.html&quot; hide:true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;file://C:/Private/journals/2006-12.html&quot; delay:8000&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;../tests/STP/sample33.html&quot; hide&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;include &quot;tests/main_sample.html&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}
__Note__: some browsers forbid including from outside the folder where the including TW is placed. See details in the &quot;Installation, configuring and troubleshooting&quot; section.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;See main documentation [[at tiddlywiki.org|http://tiddlywiki.org/#Filters]]. Note: when the {{{tiddler}}} filter is used, if tiddler with {{{tiddlerName}}} doesn't exist, the filter creates a new empty tiddler and adds it to the set. To avoid problems like blank ~PageTemplate etc, tiddlers which don't exist are not included (or imported) even if the {{{tiddler}}} filter would cause otherwise.

STP introduces 3 new filters:
* {{{all}}} (mostly for inner purposes) which brings all the tiddlers of a store. Usage:
** {{{[all[with included]]}}} fetches ordinary and included tiddlers (with regard to &quot;substituting&quot;)
** {{{[all[-]]}}} (with any non-empty argument other than &quot;with included&quot;) fetches only ordinary tiddlers (without regard to &quot;substituting&quot;)
** Example: {{{[all[-]] [sort[modified]]}}}.
* {{{includedFrom}}} which retains only tiddlers from a certain included store. Examples: {{{[tag[ToDo]] [includedFrom[project.html]], [tag[ToDo]] [includedFrom[node: project]]}}}.
* {{{internal}}} which filters out included tiddlers. Example: {{{[tag[ToDo]] [internal[-]]}}}.
* {{{external}}} which leaves only included tiddlers. Example: {{{[all[with included]] [external[-]]}}}.

Example of usage with the {{{include}}} macro:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./biology.html&quot; filters:&quot;[tag[Mammals]] [[Mammals]]&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Name conflicts and priorities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Sometimes there are tiddlers with a common name in the main and an included or multiple included ~TiddlyWikis -- this may occur &quot;accidentally&quot; or because one needs to substitute a tiddler in the main ~TiddlyWiki by an included one (like shared ~PageTemplate). In such cases the following rules work:

* each tiddler in each store has or doesn't have some priorities which is defined when the tiddler is included
* shadowed tiddlers are substituted only by tiddlers with the &quot;substituteShadows&quot; priority
* tiddlers inside the main ~TiddlyWiki substitute those in included ones, unless those have &quot;substitute&quot; priority, in which case it is otherwise
* ({{{sh ambiguity}}}) if there are multiple tiddlers with &quot;substituteShadows&quot; and the shadow presents, there's no specific rule that defines which one would be fetched instead of the shadow; if the shadow with such name doesn't exist, those are treated as included tiddlers without &quot;substituteShadows&quot;
* ({{{s ambiguity}}}) if there are multiple tiddlers with &quot;substitute&quot;, the same thing applies: a &quot;random&quot; one is chosen (this actually depends on the order of the handling of {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros)
* ({{{ambiguity}}}) the same is true for tiddlers included with no added priorities

For tracking conflicts, a notification system is present:

* notifications appear if at least one of these parameters is set to {{{true}}} (see the &quot;tweak&quot; panel in the sidebar):
** {{{chkWarnOnSharedTiddlersConflicts}}} -- displays messages (this is usually interrupted by refreshing engines) and writes them to the browser console
** {{{chkAlertOnSharedTiddlersConflicts}}} -- alerts (in contrast to displaying messages, you won't lose this ones, but you have to click &quot;ok&quot; after each one, so this is to be used when setting up)
* for some reason (probably some page-refreshing called from out of the plugin) notifications are not displayed each time conflicts appear, or are removed too fast (when displaying fails logs and alerts can help)
* notifications are displayed in each case: {{{sh ambiguity}}}, {{{s ambiguity}}}, {{{ambiguity}}} and when there's a tiddler T in the main store and one tiddler with the same name in an included store without the &quot;substitute&quot; priority (in the last two cases the tiddler in the main store is also described as &quot;conflicting&quot; for the ease of understanding what's going on, despite the fact it is fetched for sure, not any included one)
* it is implied that shadows are not added after {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros are handled (otherwise some notifications will appear as in the {{{ambiguity}}} case while after a shadow is added it can become the {{{sh ambiguity}}})

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The &quot;reloadIncluded&quot; macro and reloading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The {{{reloadIncluded}}} macro creates a &quot;link&quot; which causes reloading of the corresponding ~TWs: the content is unloaded and then previously wikified {{{include}}} macros are handled again. Syntax:
{{{
&lt;&lt;reloadIncluded [urls:urlsJSON] [reloadParams:otherReloadParamsJSON]
		[label:labelText] [tooltip:tooltipText] [class:className]&gt;&gt;
}}}
The {{{label}}}, {{{tooltip}}} and {{{class}}} parameters are sefl-explaining; it's worth mentioning the {{{button}}} class which is used in macros like {{{tag}}} and {{{slider}}}. The other two parameters should be in the JSON format, like this (note the double quotes, esp. around {{{import}}}):
{{{
urls:'[&quot;node: node1&quot;, &quot;included test nodes/node 2.html&quot;]' reloadParams:'{&quot;import&quot;:false}'
}}}
The {{{urls}}} defines the ~TWs to reload (if not present, means &quot;reload all&quot;). The {{{reloadParams}}} part defines whether to wikify again {{{include}}} macros with the {{{import}}}/{{{wikify}}}/{{{eval}}} params, by default only {{{eval}}} is set to false to avoid repeated evaluation of shared plugins (and in this example {{{import}}} is set to {{{false}}} as well).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The &quot;includeState&quot; macro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The {{{&lt;&lt;includeState&gt;&gt;}}} macro can be used to see the progress of inclusion of ~TiddlyWikis (e.g. &quot;included&quot; for those already loaded, or a text of an error for others etc). There's a shadow IncludeState where you can see it in work.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Import tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;As some plugins and other things should present inside each tw-document rather than be &quot;shared&quot; (like [[NestedSlidersPlugin|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#NestedSlidersPlugin]], without which some content will be &quot;spoiled&quot;), tools to import/autoimport tiddlers from other ~TiddlyWikis are introduced.

Importing can be done in different __import modes__, currently the following are available:
* {{{1}}} means &quot;import anyway, even if a tiddler with such name is present&quot; (useful, for instance, as &quot;silent mode for plugins&quot;)
* {{{2}}} means &quot;skip import if a version of this tiddler in the main store has 'modified' date no less than that of importing one&quot;
* {{{3}}} means &quot;import on confirm of the user&quot;
* {{{4}}} combines the requirements of the modes {{{2}}} and {{{3}}} for import to happen (useful as &quot;totally controlled&quot; import, say for autoupdating plugins from a central TW)
The results of import are currently only logged in a browser's console.

There are 2 ways to import:
* autoimport via the {{{include}}} macro (with the {{{import:importMode}}} argument, import is done instead of including)
* manual import via the tool in the ImportIncluded shadow (using a url, a filter and a mode; the default is the {{{1}}} mode)
Don't forget to save your TW if this is needed (STP sets the usual TW reminder of unsaved changes, but only for browsers which support it)

An example:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;./commons/plugins.html&quot; filter:&quot;[tag[commonInPlacePlugins]]&quot; import:4&gt;&gt;
}}}

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evaluating tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The {{{eval}}} parameter of the {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macro allows to use plugins included from other ~TWs. For instance,
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;commonPlugins.html&quot; filters:&quot;[[CollapseTiddlersPlugin]] [[RearrangeTiddlersPlugin]]&quot; eval&gt;&gt;
}}}
will load two plugins and evaluate them as ~JavaScript (they can be without {{{systemConfig}}} tag). In current implementation, some differences from the conventional way to launch plugins are present: plugins are not registered (no entries in the backstage), no dedicated reaction on errors; also, there's no check preventing some plugin to launch twice or more. Note: if evaluated, tiddlers still will be included or imported.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&quot;include&quot; macros outside the IncludeList and transitive inclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;While {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros inside the ~IncludeList tiddler are handled at the startup, one can also place them in other tiddlers so that new parts are included when the tiddlers are displayed (the ''hide'' option can be useful here). This can save some time at startup; {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros outside ~IncludeList also provide the possibility of transitive inclusion (see below). However, sometimes opening a tiddler with an {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macro can take several (mili)seconds.

When ~TiddlyWiki B is included to ~TiddlyWiki A, even if ~IncludeList is included with substitution, this won't bring tiddlers included to B in A, because the startup action is already done (see {{{wikifyIncluded}}} macro, though). However, it's possible to get &quot;transitive inclusion&quot; in the following meaning: add some tiddler with {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} in B (for instance, a tiddler &quot;Fruits&quot; with the follwing content:
{{{
All fruits: &lt;&lt;include &quot;./food.html&quot; filters:&quot;[tag[Fruit]]&quot; hide&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;tag [[Fruit]]&gt;&gt;
}}}
where &quot;./food.html&quot; is a third ~TiddlyWiki), then if you include this tiddler to A, you will get all the &quot;Fruit&quot;-tagged tiddlers included in A and the tiddler &quot;Fruits&quot; will be displayed as in B (*if* A and B are in the same directory -- otherwise the &quot;./food.html&quot; path will be incorrect in A).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Including remote TiddlyWikis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Although the documentation of the ~IncludePlugin sais that it's possible to include some remote ~TiddlyWikis into a local one, in modern browsers this seemingly no longer works (tested in IP 1.0.1 and STP 1.3 + Opera 12.0-16.0 and ~FireFox 13.0.1). On the other hand, when running a ~TiddlyWiki on a webserver, one can include ~TWs from the same domain, but can't include any TW from a different website (because of so-called &quot;~Cross-Site Scripting&quot; security issue). @@font-size:smaller;Including remote ~TiddlyWikis into a local one may be reintroduced in the future, but this requires changing the load engine which means some extensive search. Any feedback or ideas regarding this issue are particularly appreciated.@@

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making secondary TiddlyWikis smaller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;In some cases included ~TWs can be supposed not to get changed (like archived pieces of journal or news) and be desired to be smaller (especially when placed at a web-site) at the same time. In such cases included ~TiddlyWikis can be reduced to the [[PureStore|http://yakovl.bplaced.net/TW/STP/STP.html#PureStore]] format.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The TwWeb and the describeNode macro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;The {{{describeNode}}} macro addes a description of a node (a ~TiddlyWiki) to the ~TwWeb. Minimal description consists of the name of the node and its address:
{{{
&lt;&lt;describeNode &quot;nodeName&quot; &quot;path to the node/file.html&quot;&gt;&gt;
}}}
Once a node is described, its name can be used instead of its url. This is supported in the {{{include}}} macro:
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;node: nodeName&quot; ...&gt;&gt;
}}}
If such macro is wikified before the node was described, it &quot;waits&quot; for the description to appear. This syntax also can be used in the ImportIncluded.

Also, this is supported in the extended form of prettyLinks:
{{{
[[link text|target tiddler]]@nodeName
}}}
where {{{nodeName}}} contains alphanumeric symbols (latin letters, numbers and {{{_}}} symbols), is equivalent to
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;node: nodeName&quot; filters:&quot;[[target tiddler]]&quot; hide noRefresh&gt;&gt;
[[link text|target tiddler]]
}}}
(except no linebreak is added) and
{{{
[[link text|target tiddler]]@nodeName@param string@
}}}
is equivalent to
{{{
&lt;&lt;include &quot;node: nodeName&quot; filters:&quot;[[target tiddler]]&quot; hide noRefresh param string&gt;&gt;
[[link text|target tiddler]]
}}}
where {{{param string}}} is copied &quot;as is&quot; (to get {{{import:4}}} option of the macro, write param string {{{import:4}}} etc). There's a limitation: {{{param string}}} is only recognized when consists of alphanumeric symbols, space symbols and {{{:}}} (so evaluated parameters are not allowed).

There's another function of the {{{describeNode}}} macro: when used like this
{{{
&lt;&lt;describeNode nodeName self&gt;&gt;
}}}
it sets the name {{{nodeName}}} as the name of the main ~TiddlyWiki. Any including from the node {{{nodeName}}} (which may be caused by an included tiddler) won't work. This only works once meaning that the following markup
{{{
&lt;&lt;describeNode nodeName1 self&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;describeNode nodeName2 self&gt;&gt;
}}}
will result in setting {{{nodeName1}}} as the name of the main TW and the second macro will alert about itseft but do nothing else.
----
By ~TwWeb a system that handles all the nodes stuff is meant (not to confuse with ~TiddlyWeb). ~TwWeb is a part of STP.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Propagation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;STP prevents some parts of included tiddlers to get broken because they are in the context of the including TW, not the included one. What currently STP does:

* pretty links without {{{@nodeName}}} in included tiddlers, when displayed, cause including of corresponding tiddlers (so links are not broken). This is another part of the hijacking the &quot;prettyLink&quot; formatter and is optional (see &quot;Installation, configuring and troubleshooting&quot; section)
* image formatter ({{{[img[path][link]]}}} syntax) now takes care of relative links ({{{path}}} part is recalced from the including path). This is also optional, &quot;Installation, configuring and troubleshooting&quot; section.

What is not currently implemented:

* no macros are taken care of -- even a transclusion won't work if the corresponding tiddler is not explicitly included (and, of course, more complex macros like {{{tag}}} or {{{list}}})
* name conflicts are not handled: pretty links just cause including, and if there's a tiddler with the same name inside including TW, the priority system applies (deciding which one will be displayed on click)
* (auto)import doesn't account any of these things, including pretty links

Within these docs, such mechanisms are called &quot;propagation&quot; (of links, images etc).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inline management of included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;In the edit mode an included tiddler has an additional panel to manage it. This is implemented by hijacking the {{{edit}}} macro, no changes to EditTemplate are needed. The panel has {{{manageIncludedPanel}}} that can be used for style settings.

!Installation, configuring and troubleshooting
&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;First, put the plugin inside your ~TiddlyWiki. This is done as always: import the SharedTiddlersPlugin tiddler (using ImportTiddlers or another engine) or copy it (don't forget the {{{systemConfig}}} tag). You'll need to restart your ~TiddlyWiki (refresh the page) to get it working -- then you may check if it's installed properly in the PluginManager. You can also import or copy this documentation to have it at hand when needed.

Second, add {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros to IncludeList and wherever you need them. As IncludeList is wikified when you view it, you don't need to restart the &quot;main&quot; ~TiddlyWiki, despite the fact that IncludeList is processed on startup. Add links, transclusions and other &quot;connections&quot; with included tiddlers, if necessary. Search, timeline, {{{&lt;&lt;tag&gt;&gt;}}} and other macros can be used as well.

Now you're ready to go. Remember that included tiddlers are readonly in the &quot;main&quot; ~TiddlyWiki, so you have to go to &quot;original&quot; ~TiddlyWikis to edit them.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;You may need to change one of these settings:
* &lt;&lt;option chkUseInclude&gt;&gt; {{{chkUseInclude}}} option -- uncheck this and reload your ~TiddlyWiki to stop all inclusions
* &lt;&lt;option chkWarnOnSharedTiddlersConflicts&gt;&gt; {{{chkWarnOnSharedTiddlersConflicts}}} option -- defines whether notifications of conflicts should be displayed and logged
* &lt;&lt;option chkAlertOnSharedTiddlersConflicts&gt;&gt; {{{chkAlertOnSharedTiddlersConflicts}}} option -- defines whether alerting shoud be used for notifying about conflicts
* extending prettyLinks is optional, too; because the hijacking is done at startup, the option is hardcoded: to change it, go to SharedTiddlersPlugin and in the {{{config.options.STP_hijackPrettyLink = true;}}} set {{{false}}} instead
* such is extending of the image formatter ({{{[img[path][link]]}}}): it's governed by the {{{config.options.STP_hijackImageFormatter = ...}}} line in SharedTiddlersPlugin
These along with links to IncludeList, IncludeState and these documentation in the web can be found in AdvancedOptions.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;If something goes wrong, you should check:
* core version of your TW: it must be no less than the ~CoreVersion value in the [[SharedTiddlersPlugin]]'s header. You can check it using the {{{&lt;&lt;version&gt;&gt;}}} macro. Also, if [[UpToDateFiltersPlugin|http://yakovl.bplaced.net/TW/ExtraFilters.html#UpToDateFiltersPlugin]] is not installed, it must be 2.6.2 or greater
* the PluginManager -- ~SharedTiddlersPlugin should be present there, be not Disabled, have no error log (if all of these is true, than the plugin is installed correctly); also, only one copy of ~SharedTiddlersPlugin or ~IncludePlugin should be installed
* if the plugin is installed correctly, inspect the {{{chkUseInclude}}} option -- should be checked for the plugin to work
* if the problem is not because of {{{chkUseInclude}}}, go to the IncludeState and see if any problems are reported there
** in some browsers there are additional security settings which can forbid loading other ~TWs, see [[Known Problems with Importing in TiddlyWiki|http://tiddlywiki.com/#%5B%5BTiddlyWiki%20Browser%20Compatibility%5D%5D]] section at tiddlywiki.com (it is about importing, but applies to &quot;including&quot; as well). Problems with ~FireFox seem to be solved by either updating to STP v1.5.0+ or TW v2.7.0+
* some browsers forbid including from outside the folder where the including TW is placed. According to tests, addresses containing &quot;..&quot; (container folder) work in Opera (12.15), Safari (5.0.3), IE (10.0) and don't work in ~FireFox (20.0), Chrome (26.0). In ~FireFox, this can be &quot;fixed&quot; by changing a security option: to do this, in the address bar type {{{about:config}}}, press enter, search for the {{{security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy}}} option and set it to {{{false}}} (fortunately, this works even in Android).
If the problem remains, you can search or post your issue in the [[community newsgroup|http://groups.google.com/group/tiddlywiki]] and if it's not solved, you can also notify the maintainer by email (don't forget to add the link to the thread).

!More details on possible applications
In general, ~SharedTiddlersPlugin can help with the following:
* reducing sizes of ~TiddlyWikis which can speed up saving TW and loading from the web, when used as a web-page/site
** examples: old journal/news tiddlers can &quot;archived&quot; into a separate TW monthly so that your diary/blog/site remains approximately the same size but old entries are easily accessible
* using common content in several ~TiddlyWikis
** like some glossary, or help texts about ~TiddlyWiki or some plugins (like ~SharedTiddlersPlugin which has this extensive documentation)
** in this case it's usually easy to avoid name conflicts -- just try to make sure that in the shared document tiddler names are specific enough
* using common interface
** ~PageTemplate, style sheets and other parts of ~TiddlyWiki theme can be shared (don't forget &quot;substitute&quot;/&quot;substituteShadows&quot; priorities, depending on what is present in a document you include those into)
*** all ~PageTemplate, ~StyleSheet, ~ViewTemplate, ~EditTemplate and ~ToolbarCommands are applied as expected; however, it is done by extra refreshing which causes already displayed messages to disappear (on handling of the {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macro)
** included elements can also be used as parts of a custom theme (instead of substituting the default ones); style sheets can be included in the StyleSheet tiddler as well (by adding lines like {{{[[IncludedStyleSheet]]}}} into it)
** evaluated transclusions can be shared as well (and other stuff which is rendered as it shows, like {{{&lt;html&gt;}}}-insertions)
** finally, included plugins can be evaluated (see the &quot;Detailed reference&quot; part of this docs)
*** keep in mind that for some plugins it's more suitable to import them rather than include and evaluate
* aggregating content from other ~TWs
** ~SharedTiddlersPlugin can be used to get all tiddlers with &quot;~ToDo&quot; tag from all ~TiddlyWikis in a separate TW and other things like that
** usually this wouldn't require extra efforts, but if you expect name conflicts and need to get access to all the tiddlers (including different ones with the same name), check &quot;API changes and coding with ~SharedTiddlersPlugin&quot; section for details
** @@font-size:smaller;[currently unavailable, see &quot;Detailed reference&quot; section for details]@@ it's also can be useful to aggregate tiddlers from web (from online ~TiddlyWikis, like http://www.tiddlywiki.com/index.html), which can bring you news from tiddly world or just from people you know who use ~TiddlyWiki; but remember the cross-site restriction
* finally, ~SharedTiddlersPlugin can be used to &quot;merge&quot; content of several ~TWs
** for instance, if you have a TW dedicated to science you're doing and a TW created for learning (at university or anyhow else), there definitely can appear some topics that belong to both wikis; it's rather weird thing to create new ~TiddlyWikis for each such topic, so you can keep tiddlers in one of them and include them to another for smoother workflow
** however, because included tiddlers are read-only, &quot;default&quot; workflow is not absolutely smooth as you'll need to go to the wiki containing tiddlers &quot;originally&quot; to change them

!API changes and coding with SharedTiddlersPlugin
&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accessing stores&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Each included ~TiddlyWiki is represented as a {{{TiddlyWiki}}} object, like the main one is. While for main ~TiddlyWiki it's the global {{{store}}} instance of {{{TiddlyWiki}}}, included ones can be accessed as following:
{{{
  var includedStore = window.sharedTiddlersAPI.getStore(tiddyWikiURL);
}}}
@@font-size:smaller;For backward compability, there's still {{{abego.TiddlyWikiIncluder.getStore(tiddyWikiURL)}}} method which is not recomended to use (see below).@@
Those included stores have only those tiddlers which are included (taking account of the ''filter'' parameters of {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros). Each of them has an additional property,
{{{
  var fullStore = includedStore.orig_store;
}}}
which is another {{{TiddlyWiki}}} that contains ''all'' the tiddlers of the included TW document.

The list of urls of all included ~TiddlyWikis can be accessed using the
{{{
  window.sharedTiddlersAPI.getIncludes()
}}}
method (it returns an array of strings – urls). Currently, this array contains urls exactly as they were written in {{{&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;}}} macros and, for instance, two macros with &quot;example included.html&quot; and &quot;example%20included.html&quot; urls create two different included stores.
@@font-size:smaller;For backward compability, there's also {{{abego.TiddlyWikiIncluder.getIncludes()}}} method which is not recomended to use (see below).@@

To get the state of a {{{store}}} (loaded, or some error occured when loading, etc), the
{{{
  window.sharedTiddlersAPI.getState(tiddyWikiURL)
}}}
method can be used. It returns {{{null}}} when the store is already loaded or a a state/error text otherwise.
@@font-size:smaller;For backward compability, there's also {{{abego.TiddlyWikiIncluder.getState(tiddyWikiURL)}}} method which is not recomended to use (see below).@@

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accessing tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;As {{{TiddlyWiki}}} instances, both {{{includedStore}}} and {{{fullStore}}} in these examples have corresponding methods, like {{{fetchTiddler}}} etc.

Normally, however, one wouldn't use these direct methods. Instead, there's hijacked
{{{
  store.fetchTiddler(title)
}}}
which fetches a tiddler from the set of &quot;original&quot; and &quot;included&quot; ones taking into account the &quot;substituting&quot;. There's also
{{{
  window.sharedTiddlersAPI.forReallyEachTiddler(callback)
}}}
method which does the same thing as {{{store.forEachTiddler}}}, but &quot;iterates&quot; all the tiddlers taking into account the &quot;substituting&quot;. Main {{{store}}} methods {{{reverseLookup}}}, {{{updateTiddlers}}}, {{{getTags}}}, {{{getMissingLinks}}}, {{{getOrphans}}} are hijacked in the same way. Finally, already existing functions that use {{{store.forEachTiddler}}} can be modified so that it works as {{{sharedTiddlersAPI.forReallyEachTiddler}}} (see the &quot;Making other plugins &quot;include-aware&quot;&quot; section of these docs).

All original tiddlers from the main store can be accessed via the
{{{
  window.sharedTiddlersAPI.orig_fetchTiddler(title)
}}}
and the original (not hijacked)
{{{
  store.forEachTiddler(callback)
}}}

Notes:
* normally, the {{{window.}}} prefix can be omitted
* methods of {{{abego.TiddlyWikiIncluder}}} are retained so that users of ~IncludePlugin don't need to change their scripts if moving to ~SharedTiddlersPlugin. However, it is recomended that those methods are substituted with those from the {{{sharedTiddlersAPI}}} &quot;namespace&quot;.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;With SharedTiddlersPlugin, tiddlers get a new property, the url of the store they were included from. It can be got by the {{{getIncludeURL()}}} method of the {{{Tiddler}}} object: it returns the url if the tiddler was included and {{{null}}} otherwise (if it's from the main {{{store}}}).

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Importing included tiddlers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;To easily import included tiddlers, the following function can be used:
{{{
  window.sharedTiddlersAPI.importAndLog(tiddler,mode)
}}}
It strips {{{includeURL}}} from the {{{tiddler}}}, imports it in the corresponding {{{mode}}} and logs the results in the browser console. The {{{mode}}} argument is optional, mode numbers can be used either as {{{1}}} or {{{&quot;1&quot;}}}; for the list of modes see &quot;Import tools&quot; in &quot;Detailed reference&quot;.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

!Making other plugins include-aware
To make external tiddlers usable, ~SharedTiddlersPlugin basically does 3 things:

* hijackes the {{{fetchTiddler}}} method of the main {{{store}}} object
* &quot;recalcs&quot; slices by deleting them
* makes some core functions see {{{store.forEachTiddler}}} as thought as it were hijacked (so that it iterates all the tiddlers that {{{fetchTiddler}}} gets)

If you want a plugin to act with regard to including and it uses {{{store.forEachTiddler}}}, you need to do this &quot;partial hijacking&quot; of it. This can be done in several ways, but probably the best one is the following:

* for ~SomePlugin using functions {{{func1}}}, {{{func2}}}, ..., {{{funcN}}} and objects with methods {{{obj1.met1}}}, ... {{{objM.metL}}} utilizing {{{store.forEachTiddler}}} form a piece of &quot;hijacking code&quot; that will make them &quot;include-aware&quot; – lines like:{{justDiv{
{{{
func1 = config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin.getFunctionUsingForReallyEachTiddler(func1);
}}}
}}}For objects, there's an analogue which is used like this:{{justDiv{
{{{
config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin.useForReallyEachTiddler(obj1,met1);
}}}
}}}
** current implementation makes &quot;double hijacking&quot; to work as an ordinary one, so even if {{{func1}}} calls {{{func2}}} and both are hijacked, {{{func2}}} will work correctly; but in some such cases it's not necessary to hijack all the functions and methods
** be careful with functions which modify ~TiddlyWiki store: by hijacking everything you can get external tiddlers saved in the main TW
* make sure that ~SharedTiddlersPlugin tiddler contains the &quot;Name&quot; slice. In the end of ~SomePlugin add this code (put the &quot;hijacking code&quot; where pointed):{{justDiv{
{{{
var isSharedTiddlersPluginEnabled = function() {
	for(var i = 0; i &lt; installedPlugins.length; i++)
		if(installedPlugins[i].Name == &quot;SharedTiddlersPlugin&quot; &amp;&amp; isPluginEnabled(installedPlugins[i]))
			return true;
	return false;
};
var makeInclusionAware = function() {
	var now = false;
	if(config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin)
		if(config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin.useForReallyEachTiddler)
			now = true;
	if(now) {
		// &quot;hijacking code&quot; goes here
	} else
		setTimeout(makeInclusionAware,100);
};
if(isSharedTiddlersPluginEnabled())
	makeInclusionAware();
}}}
}}}
* restart to apply this &quot;patch&quot;

&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;Previously, other abego plugins were made &quot;include-aware&quot; right in the ~IncludePlugin/~SharedTiddlersPlugin code:
{{{
//================================================================================
// Make IntelliTagger &quot;Include-aware&quot;

var patchIntelliTagger = function() {
	if (abego.IntelliTagger)
		useForReallyEachTiddler(abego.IntelliTagger,&quot;assistTagging&quot;);
};

//================================================================================
// Make ForEachTiddler &quot;Include-aware&quot;

var patchForEachTiddler = function() {
	if (config.macros.forEachTiddler)
		// Note: this will not patch the TiddlyWiki passed to findTiddlers but the &quot;global&quot; store
		// This is by intent
		useForReallyEachTiddler(config.macros.forEachTiddler,&quot;findTiddlers&quot;);
};

...

invokeLater(patchIntelliTagger,100);
invokeLater(patchForEachTiddler,100);
}}}
This pieces of code are removed from ~SharedTiddlersPlugin; to make ~ForEachTiddler &quot;see&quot; included tiddlers, add the following to the end of the ~ForEachTiddlerPlugin code:
{{{
var isSharedTiddlersPluginEnabled = function() {
	for(var i = 0; i &lt; installedPlugins.length; i++)
		if(installedPlugins[i].Name == &quot;SharedTiddlersPlugin&quot; &amp;&amp; isPluginEnabled(installedPlugins[i]))
			return true;
	return false;
};
var makeInclusionAware = function() {
	var now = false;
	if(config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin)
		if(config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin.useForReallyEachTiddler)
			now = true;
	if(now) {
		// the place for hijacks
		config.extensions.SharedTiddlersPlugin.useForReallyEachTiddler(config.macros.forEachTiddler,&quot;findTiddlers&quot;);
	} else
		setTimeout(makeInclusionAware,100);
};
if(isSharedTiddlersPluginEnabled())
	makeInclusionAware();
}}}
Then (after restarting), you can try its work by creating a table of included tiddlers:
{{{
&lt;&lt;forEachTiddler
	where
		'tiddler.includeURL'
	write
		'&quot;|[[&quot; +tiddler.title+&quot;]]|&quot;+tiddler.includeURL+&quot;|\n&quot;'
	    begin
		    '&quot;| name | came from |h\n&quot;'
&gt;&gt;
}}}

Notes:
* The &quot;display one tiddler at a time&quot; option can also be //temporarily// set/reset by including a 'paramifier' in the document URL: {{{#SPM:true}}} or {{{#SPM:false}}}.
* If more than one display mode is selected, 'one at a time' display takes precedence over both 'top' and 'bottom' settings, and if 'one at a time' setting is not used, 'top of page' takes precedence over 'bottom of page'.
* When using Apple's Safari browser, automatically setting the permalink causes an error and is disabled.

|Description|Documentation for SinglePageModePlugin|
Normally, as you click on the links in TiddlyWiki, more and more tiddlers are displayed on the page. The order of this tiddler display depends upon when and where you have clicked. Some people like this non-linear method of reading the document, while others have reported that when many tiddlers have been opened, it can get somewhat confusing.  SinglePageModePlugin allows you to configure TiddlyWiki to navigate more like a traditional multipage web site with only one item displayed at a time.
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When the plugin is enabled, only one tiddler will be displayed at a time and the browser window's titlebar is updated to include the current tiddler title.  The browser's location URL is also updated with a 'permalink' for the current tiddler so that it is easier to create a browser 'bookmark' for the current tiddler.  Alternatively, even when displaying multiple tiddlers //is// permitted, you can still reduce the potential for confusion by forcing  tiddlers to always open at the top (or bottom) of the page instead of being displayed following the tiddler containing the link that was clicked.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
&lt;&lt;option chkSinglePageMode&gt;&gt; Display one tiddler at a time
&gt;&lt;&lt;option chkSinglePagePermalink&gt;&gt; Automatically permalink current tiddler
&gt;&lt;&lt;option chkSinglePageKeepFoldedTiddlers&gt;&gt; Don't close tiddlers that are folded
&gt;&lt;&lt;option chkSinglePageKeepEditedTiddlers&gt;&gt; Don't close tiddlers that are being edited
&lt;&lt;option chkTopOfPageMode&gt;&gt; Open tiddlers at the top of the page
&lt;&lt;option chkBottomOfPageMode&gt;&gt; Open tiddlers at the bottom of the page
&lt;&lt;option chkSinglePageAutoScroll&gt;&gt; Automatically scroll tiddler into view (if needed)

Notes:
* {{block{
The &quot;display one tiddler at a time&quot; option can also be //temporarily// set/reset by including a 'paramifier' in the document URL: {{{#SPM:true}}} or {{{#SPM:false}}}. You can also use {{{SPM:expression}}}, where 'expression' is any javascript statement that evaluates to true or false.  This allows you to create hard-coded links in other documents that can selectively enable/disable the use of this option based on various programmatic conditions, such as the current username. For example, using
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{{#SPM:config.options.txtUserName!=&quot;SomeName&quot;}}}
enables 'one tiddler at a time' display for all users //other than// &quot;~SomeName&quot;)}}}
* If more than one display mode is selected, 'one at a time' display takes precedence over both 'top' and 'bottom' settings, and if 'one at a time' setting is not used, 'top of page' takes precedence over 'bottom of page'.
* When using Apple's Safari browser, automatically setting the permalink causes an error and is disabled.

!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2008.10.17 2.9.6 changed chkSinglePageAutoScroll default to false
2008.06.12 2.9.5 corrected 'scroll to top of page' logic in auto-scroll handling
2008.06.11 2.9.4 added chkSinglePageKeepEditedTiddlers option
2008.06.05 2.9.3 in displayTiddler(), bypass single/top/bottom mode handling if startingUp.  Allows multiple tiddlers to be displayed during startup processing (e.g., #story:DefaultTiddlers), even if single/top/bottom mode is enabled.
2008.04.18 2.9.2 in displayTiddler() and checkLastURL(), handling for Unicode in tiddler titles (remove explicit conversion between Unicode and UTF, as this is apparently done automatically by encode/decodeURIComponent, resulting in double-encoding!
2008.04.08 2.9.1 don't automatically add options to AdvancedOptions shadow tiddler
2008.04.02 2.9.0 in displayTiddler(), when single-page mode is in use and a tiddler is being edited, ask for permission to save-and-close that tiddler, instead of just leaving it open.
2008.03.29 2.8.3 in displayTiddler(), get title from tiddler object (if needed).  Fixes errors caused when calling function passes a tiddler *object* instead of a tiddler *title*
2008.03.14 2.8.2 in displayTiddler(), if editing specified tiddler, just move it to top/bottom of story *without* re-rendering (prevents discard of partial edits).
2008.03.06 2.8.1 in paramifier handler, start 'checkURL' timer if chkSinglePageMode is enabled
2008.03.06 2.8.0 added option, {{{config.options.chkSinglePageKeepFoldedTiddlers}}}, so folded tiddlers won't be closed when using single-page mode.  Also, in checkURL(), if hash is a ''permaview'' (e.g., &quot;#foo bar baz&quot;), then display multiple tiddlers rather than attempting to display &quot;foo bar baz&quot; as a single tiddler
2008.03.05 2.7.0 added support for &quot;SPM:&quot; URL paramifier
2008.03.01 2.6.0 in hijack of displayTiddler(), added 'title' argument to closeAllTiddlers() so that target tiddler isn't closed-and-reopened if it was already displayed.  Also, added config.options.chkSinglePageAutoScrolloption to bypass automatic 'scroll into view' logic (note: core still does it's own ensureVisible() handling)
2007.12.22 2.5.3 in checkLastURL(), use decodeURIComponent() instead of decodeURI so that tiddler titles with commas (and/or other punctuation) are correctly handled.
2007.10.26 2.5.2 documentation cleanup
2007.10.08 2.5.1 in displayTiddler(), when using single-page or top-of-page mode, scrollTo(0,0) to ensure that page header is in view.
2007.09.13 2.5.0 for TPM/BPM modes, don't force tiddler to redisplay if already shown.  Allows transition between view/edit or collapsed/view templates, without repositioning displayed tiddler.
2007.09.12 2.4.0 added option to disable automatic permalink feature.  Also, Safari is now excluded from permalinking action to avoid bug where tiddlers don't display after hash is updated.
2007.03.03 2.3.1 fix typo when adding BPM option to AdvancedOptions (prevented checkbox from appearing)
2007.03.03 2.3.0 added support for BottomOfPageMode (BPM) based on request from DaveGarbutt
2007.02.06 2.2.3 in Story.prototype.displayTiddler(), use convertUnicodeToUTF8() for correct I18N string handling when creating URL hash string from tiddler title (based on bug report from BidiX)
2007.01.08 2.2.2 use apply() to invoke hijacked core functions
2006.07.04 2.2.1 in hijack for displayTiddlers(), suspend TPM as well as SPM so that DefaultTiddlers displays in the correct order.
2006.06.01 2.2.0 added chkTopOfPageMode (TPM) handling
2006.02.04 2.1.1 moved global variable declarations to config.* to avoid FireFox 1.5.0.1 crash bug when assigning to globals
2005.12.27 2.1.0 hijack displayTiddlers() so that SPM can be suspended during startup while displaying the DefaultTiddlers (or #hash list).  Also, corrected initialization for undefined SPM flag to &quot;false&quot;, so default behavior is to display multiple tiddlers
2005.12.27 2.0.0 Update for TW2.0
2005.11.24 1.1.2 When the back and forward buttons are used, the page now changes to match the URL.  Based on code added by Clint Checketts
2005.10.14 1.1.1 permalink creation now calls encodeTiddlyLink() to handle tiddler titles with spaces in them
2005.10.14 1.1.0 added automatic setting of window title and location bar ('auto-permalink').  feature suggestion by David Dickens.
2005.10.09 1.0.1 combined documentation and code in a single tiddler
2005.08.15 1.0.0 Initial Release

|License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements|
|~CoreVersion|2.1|
|Type|plugin|
|Description|blocks tiddlers tagged with &quot;temporary&quot; from being saved into the TW file|
!!!!!Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When the TW document is saved (either to local disk or remote URL), any tiddlers tagged with &quot;temporary&quot; will be skipped over, so that they are not written to the file.  To keep a temporary tiddler, simply edit it and remove the tag before saving the file.  This feature can be combined with various plugins that can automatically create new tiddlers, such as [[SearchOptionsPlugin]] ([[SearchResults]]) and [[ImportTiddlersPlugin]] ([[ImportedTiddlers]]) so that these transient results are not retained when you save you document.

You can also use this tag with the {{{&lt;&lt;loadTiddlers&gt;&gt;}}} macro and the //auto-tagging// features provided by [[ImportTiddlersPlugin]], so that each time you open your document, you can automatically retrieve an up-to-date set of common tiddlers that are stored in another document (either local or via remote URL), without those tiddlers being retained when you save your document.
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Configuration
&lt;&lt;&lt;
When saving the document:
&lt;&lt;option chkTemporaryQuiet&gt;&gt; Suppress reporting of individual temporary tiddlers that have not been saved
&lt;&lt;option chkTemporaryKeep&gt;&gt; Keep temporary tiddlers (i.e., ignore the 'temporary' tag)
Enter a tag value to use when marking tiddlers as temporary: &lt;&lt;option txtTemporaryTag&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;
!!!!!Revisions
&lt;&lt;&lt;
2008.11.14 [1.1.2] added &quot;nnn temporary tiddlers not saved&quot; summary message
2008.04.08 [1.1.1] don't automatically add configuration options to AdvancedOptions tiddler
2008.03.01 [1.1.0] added support for recognizing 'temporary' flag stored as a tiddler *field* (as an optional alternative to using a tag)

!Demo
&lt;&lt;toggleSideBar &quot;Toggle Sidebar&quot;&gt;&gt;

!Usage:
{{{&lt;&lt;toggleSideBar&gt;&gt;}}} &lt;&lt;toggleSideBar&gt;&gt;

|Name|VisitCounter|
|Source|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#VisitCounter|
|Version|3.0.1|
|Author|Eric Shulman|
|License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements|
|Type|transclusion|
|Description|use cookies to track/show private, personal visit counter and timestamp of last visit|
Usage
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Display a personal, ''//private// counter and timestamps'' for your first visit, your most recent visit, and the total number of times you have visited a document.  This data are stored in local cookies that can only be displayed in //your// browser, and are ''never relayed or reported to anyone other than yourself, nor stored or aggregated on-line in any way, __ever__.''
{{{
&lt;&lt;tiddler VisitCounter with: counterID firsttimegreeting&gt;&gt;
}}}
*''counterID'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;specifies a suffix to add to the visit tracking cookies for this document (enables tracking of multiple documents on a single domain, such as file://).  
*''firsttimegreeting'' (optional)&lt;br&gt;message to display upon first visit to the document.  Subsequent visits report last visit timestamp and total visit count.
The following cookies are used to track your visit information:
*txtFirstVisit+id
*txtLastVisit+id
*txtVisitCount+id
The script also defines global javascript run-time variables that may be referenced later in the current session by other scripts and plugins:
*config.firstVisit
*config.lastVisit
*config.visitCount
&lt;&lt;&lt;
